# Intro to RxJava

This guide aims to introduce a beginner reactive programmer to the complete power of the [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) implementation of reactive programming for the JVM. It is based on the [IntroToRx](http://www.introtorx.com) guide for Rx.NET.

No experience with either reactive or functional programming is needed to follow the book. Familiarity with the basics of Java is required.
