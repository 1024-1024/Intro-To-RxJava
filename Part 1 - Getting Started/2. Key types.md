# Key types

Rx is based around two fundamental types, and several others that expand the functionality around them. Those two types are the `Observable` and the `Observer`. we will introduce those, as well as `Subject`s, which ease the learning curve.

Rx builds upon the [Observer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) pattern. It is not unique in doing so. Event handling already exists in Java (e.g. JavaFX's EventHandler). These simpler approaches suffer in comparison to Rx:

* Events through event handlers are hard to compose.
* They cannot be queried over time
* They can lead to memory leaks
* These is no standard way of signaling completion.
* Require manual handling of concurrency and multithreading.

## Observable

[Observable](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable) is the first core element that we will see. Since Java does not support extension methods, this class contains a lot of the implementation in Rx. We will be examining it step by step throughout this book. For now, we must understand the  `Subscribe` method. Here is one key overload of the method:

```java
public final Subscription subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> subscriber)
```

This is the method that you use to receive the values emitted by the observable. As the values come to be pushed (through policies that we will discuss throughout this book), they are pushed to the subscriber, which is then responsible for the behaviour based on this example. The `Subscriber` here is an implementation of the `Observer`.

An observable pushes 3 kinds of events
* Values
* Completion, which indicates that no more values will be pushed.
* Errors, if something caused the sequence to fail. These events also imply termination.


## Observer

We already saw one abstract implementation of the [Observer](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observer.html), `Subscriber`. `Subscriber` implements some extra functionality and we will see why it is needer later. For now, we should understand the simpler interface.

```java
interface Observer<T> {
    void onCompleted();
    void onError(java.lang.Throwable e);
    void onNext(T t);
}
```

Those three methods are the behaviour that is executed every time the observable pushes a value. The observer's will have its `onNext` called zero or more times, optionally followed by an `onCompleted` or an `onError`. No calls happen after a call to `onError` or `onCompleted`.

You'll see a lot of the `Observable`, but not so much of the `Observer`. While it is important to understand the `Observer`, you'll be using a lot of method overloads that hide it.


## Implementing Observable and Observer

You could manually implement `Observer` or extend `Observable`. In reality that may be unnecessary, since Rx provides all the building blocks you need. It is also dangerous, as interaction between parts of Rx includes conventions and internal plumming that are not obvious. It is both simpler and safer to use the many tools that Rx gives you for generating the functionality that you need.

To subscribe to an observable, it is not necessary to provide instances of Observer at all. There are overloads to `subscribe` that take the functions to be executed for `onNext`, `onError` and `onSubscribe`, hiding the creation of instances. It is not even necessary to provide each of those functions. You can even provide a subset of them, i.e. for `onNext` or for `onNext` and `onError`.

The introduction of lambda functions in Java 1.8 makes these overload very convenient for our examples.

## Subject

Subjects are an extension of the `Observable` that also implements the `Observer` interface. The idea may sound odd at first, but they make things a lot simpler in some cases. They can have events pushed to them, which they then push further to their own subscribers. This makes them ideal entry points into Rx code: when you have values coming in from outside of Rx, you can push them into a `Subject`, turning them into an observable. You can think of them as entry points to an Rx pipeline.

`Subject` has two parameter types: the input type and the output type. This is not because `Subject` is the right place transform your values. There are transformation operators to do that, which we will see later.

There are a few different implementations of `Subject`. We will now examine the most important ones and their differences.

### PublishSubject

`PublishSubject` is the most straight-forward kind of subject. When a value is pushed into a `PublishSubject`, the subject pushes it to every subscriber that is subscribed to it at that moment.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	PublishSubject<Integer> subject = PublishSubject.create();
	subject.onNext(1);
	subject.subscribe(System.out::println);
	subject.onNext(2);
	subject.onNext(3);
	subject.onNext(4);
}
```
Output
```
2
3
4
```

As we can see in the example, `1` isn't printed because we weren't subscribed when it was pushed. After we subscribed, we began receiving the values that were pushed to the subject.

### ReplaySubject

`ReplaySubject` has the special feature of caching all the values pushed to it. When a new subscription is made, the event sequence is replayed from the start for the new subscriber.

```java
ReplaySubject<Integer> s = ReplaySubject.create();	
s.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Early:" + v));
s.onNext(0);
s.onNext(1);
s.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Late: " + v));	
s.onNext(2);
```
Output
```
Early:0
Early:1
Late: 0
Late: 1
Early:2
Late: 2
```

All the values are received by the subscribers, even though one was late. Also notice that the late subscriber had everything replayed to it before proceeding to the next value.

Caching everything isn't always a good idea, as an observable sequence can run for a long time. There are ways to limit the size of the internal buffer. `ReplaySubject.createWithSize` limits the size of the buffer, while `ReplaySubject.createWithTime` limits how long an object can stay cached.

```java
ReplaySubject<Integer> s = ReplaySubject.createWithSize(2);	
s.onNext(0);
s.onNext(1);
s.onNext(2);
s.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Late: " + v));	
s.onNext(3);
```

Output
```
Late: 1
Late: 2
Late: 3
```

Our late subscriber now missed the first value, which fell off our buffer of size 2.

```java
ReplaySubject<Integer> s = ReplaySubject.createWithTime(150, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, Schedulers.immediate());
s.onNext(0);
Thread.sleep(100);
s.onNext(1);
Thread.sleep(100);
s.onNext(2);
s.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Late: " + v));	
s.onNext(3);
```

Output
```
Late: 1
Late: 2
Late: 3
```

`ReplaySubject.createWithTimeAndSize` limits both, which ever comes first.

### BehaviorSubject

`BehaviorSubject` only remembers the last value. It is similar to a `ReplaySubject` with a buffer of size 1. An initial value can be provided on creation, therefore guaranteeing that a value will be available immediately on subscription.

```java
BehaviorSubject<Integer> s = BehaviorSubject.create();
s.onNext(0);
s.onNext(1);
s.onNext(2);
s.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Late: " + v));	
s.onNext(3);
```

output
```
Late: 2
Late: 3
```

The following example just completes, since that is the last event.

```java
BehaviorSubject<Integer> s = BehaviorSubject.create();
s.onNext(0);
s.onNext(1);
s.onNext(2);
s.onCompleted();
s.subscribe(
	v -> System.out.println("Late: " + v),
	e -> System.out.println("Error"),
	() -> System.out.println("Completed")
);
```

An initial value is available if anyone subscribes before the first value is pushed

```java
BehaviorSubject<Integer> s = BehaviorSubject.create(0);
s.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
s.onNext(1);
```

Output
```
0
1
```

Since the defining role of a `BehaviorSubject` is to always have a value readily available, it is unusual to create one without an initial value. It is also unusual to terminate one.

### AsyncSubject

`AsyncSubject` also caches the single last value. The difference now is that it doesn't emit anything until the sequence completes. Its use is to emit a single value and immediately complete.

```java
AsyncSubject<Integer> s = AsyncSubject.create();
s.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
s.onNext(0);
s.onNext(1);
s.onNext(2);
s.onCompleted();
```

Output 
```
2
```

Note that, if we didn't do `s.onCompleted();`, this example would have printed nothing.

## Implicit contracts

As we already mentioned, there are contracts in Rx that are not obvious in the code. An important one is that no events are emitted after a termination event (`onError` or `onCompleted`). The implemented subjects respect that:

```java
Subject<Integer, Integer> s = ReplaySubject.create();
s.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
s.onNext(0);
s.onCompleted();
s.onNext(1);
s.onNext(2);
```
Output
```
0
```
