# Key types

Rx is based around two fundamental types, and several others that expand the functionality around them. Those two types are the `Observable` and the `Observer`. we will introduce those, as well as `Subject`s, which ease the learning curve.

Rx builds upon the [Observer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) pattern. It is not unique in doing so. Event handling already exists in Java (e.g. JavaFX's EventHandler). These simpler approaches suffer in comparison to Rx:

* Events through event handlers are hard to compose.
* They cannot be queried over time
* They can lead to memory leaks
* These is no standard way of signaling completion.
* Require manual handling of concurrency and multithreading.

## Observable

[Observable](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable) is the first core element that we will see. Since Java does not support extension methods, this class contains a lot of the implementation in Rx. We will be examining it step by step throughout this book. For now, we must understand the  `Subscribe` method. Here is one key overload of the method:

```java
public final Subscription subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> subscriber)
```

This is the method that you use to receive the values emitted by the observable. As the values come to be pushed (through policies that we will discuss throughout this book), they are pushed to the subscriber, which is then responsible for the behaviour based on this example. The `Subscriber` here is an implementation of the `Observer`.

An observable pushes 3 kinds of events
* Values
* Completion, which indicates that no more values will be pushed.
* Errors, if something caused the sequence to fail. These events also imply termination.


## Observer

We already saw one abstract implementation of the [Observer](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observer.html), `Subscriber`. `Subscriber` implements some extra functionality and we will see why it is needer later. For now, we should understand the simpler interface.

```
interface Observer<T> {
    void onCompleted();
    void onError(java.lang.Throwable e);
    void onNext(T t);
}
```

Those three methods are the behaviour that is executed every time the observable pushes a value. The observer's will have its `onNext` called zero or more times, optionally followed by an `onCompleted` or an `onError`. No calls happen after a call to `onError` or `onCompleted`.

You'll see a lot of the `Observable`, but not so much of the `Observer`. While it is important to understand the `Observer`, you'll be using a lot of method overloads that hide it.


## Implementing Observable and Observer

You could manually implement or extend either the observable or the observer. That is unnecessary, since Rx provides all the building blocks you need. It is also dangerous, as interaction between parts of Rx includes conventions and internal plumming that are not enforced by the interfaces alone. It is both simpler and safer to use the many tools that Rx gives you for generating the implementations that you need.
