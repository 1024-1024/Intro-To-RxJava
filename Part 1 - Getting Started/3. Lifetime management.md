# Lifetime management

The idea behind Rx that it is unknown *when* a sequence emits values or terminates, but you still have control over when you begin and stop accepting values. Subscriptions may be linked to allocated resources that you will want to release at the end of a sequence. Rx provides control over your subscriptions to enable you to do that.

## Subscribing

There are several overloads to `Observable.subscribe`, which are shorthands for the same thing.

```java
Subscription 	subscribe()
Subscription 	subscribe(Action1<? super T> onNext)
Subscription 	subscribe(Action1<? super T> onNext, Action1<java.lang.Throwable> onError)
Subscription 	subscribe(Action1<? super T> onNext, Action1<java.lang.Throwable> onError, Action0 onComplete)
Subscription 	subscribe(Observer<? super T> observer)
Subscription 	subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> subscriber)
```

`subscribe()` consumes events but performs no actions. The overloads that take an `Action1` construct a `Subscriber` with the functions that you provide, or doing nothing where the action is missing.

In the following example, we handle the error of a sequence that failed.

```java
Subject<Integer, Integer> s = ReplaySubject.create();
s.subscribe(
    v -> System.out.println(v),
    e -> System.err.println(e));
s.onNext(0);
s.onError(new Exception("Oops"));
```

Output
```
0
java.lang.Exception: Oops
```

If we do not provide a function for error handling, an `OnErrorNotImplementedException` will be *thrown* at the point where `s.onError` is called. It happens here that the producer and the consumer are side-by-side, so you could do a try-catch. However, on a compartmentalised system you won't receive the exception unless you provide a handler to `subscribe`.

## Unsubscribing

You can also stop receiving values *before* a sequence terminates. Every `subscribe` overload returns an instance of `Subscription`, which is an interface with 2 methods:

```java
boolean 	isUnsubscribed()
void 	    unsubscribe()
```

Calling `unsubscribe` will stop events from being pushed to your observer.

```java
Subject<Integer, Integer>  values = ReplaySubject.create();
Subscription subscription = values.subscribe(
    v -> System.out.println(v),
    e -> System.err.println(e),
    () -> System.out.println("Done")
);
values.onNext(0);
values.onNext(1);
subscription.unsubscribe();
values.onNext(2);
```

Output
```java
0
1
```

Unsubscribing one observer does not interfere with other observers

```java
Subject<Integer, Integer>  values = ReplaySubject.create();
Subscription subscription1 = values.subscribe(
    v -> System.out.println("First: " + v)
);
Subscription subscription2 = values.subscribe(
	v -> System.out.println("Second: " + v)
);
values.onNext(0);
values.onNext(1);
subscription1.unsubscribe();
System.out.println("Unsubscribed first");
values.onNext(2);
```
		
Output
```
First: 0
Second: 0
First: 1
Second: 1
Unsubscribed first
Second: 2
```

## onError and onCompleted

`onError` and `onCompleted` mean the termination of a sequence. An observable that complies with the standard will not emit anything after either of those events. This is something to note both when consuming in Rx and when implementing your own observable.

```java
Subject<Integer, Integer>  values = ReplaySubject.create();
Subscription subscription1 = values.subscribe(
    v -> System.out.println("First: " + v),
    e -> System.out.println("First: " + e),
    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
);
values.onNext(0);
values.onNext(1);
values.onCompleted();
values.onNext(2);
```

Output
```
First: 0
First: 1
Completed
```

## Freeing resources

A `Subscription` can be tied to the resources it uses. For that reason, you should remember to dispose of subscriptions. You can create that binding a `Subscription` with the necessary using the [Subscriptions](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/subscriptions/Subscriptions.html) factory.

```java
Subscription s = Subscriptions.create(() -> System.out.println("Clean"));
s.unsubscribe();
```

Output
```
Clean
```

We will see more of that when we start creating observables that may use resources.
