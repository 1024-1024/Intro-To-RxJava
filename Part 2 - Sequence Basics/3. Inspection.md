# Inspection

We've just finished seeing ways to filter out data that we don't care about. Sometimes what we want is information about the sequence rather than its values. We will now introduce a few methods that revolve around reasoning about the sequence.

## all

The `all` methods establishes that every value emitted by an observable meets a criterion. Here's the signature and an example:

```java
public final Observable<java.lang.Boolean> all(Func1<? super T,java.lang.Boolean> predicate)
```

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(0);
	o.onNext(10);
	o.onNext(10);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onCompleted();
});


Subscription evenNumbers = values
	.all(i -> i % 2 == 0)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
true
Completed
```

An interesting fact about this method is that it returns an observable with a single value, rather than the boolean value directly. This is because it is unknown how long it will take to establish whether the result should be true or false. Another interesting fact is that it returns its result and completes as soon as it can know. As soon as an item fails the predicate, `false` will be emitted. A value of `true` on the other hand cannot be emitted until the source sequence has completed. We can see that in the next example

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(150, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(5);
		
Subscription subscription = values
	.all(i -> i<3)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println("All: " + v),
	    e -> System.out.println("All: Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("All: Completed")
	);
Subscription subscription2 = values
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
0
1
2
All: false
All: Completed
3
4
Completed
```

There is an Rx operator that appears in other implementations but not in RxJava, called `any`. You can easily get the same behaviour by negating the predicate of the `all` operator.

If the source observable emits an error, then `all` becomes irrelavant and the error passes through, terminating the sequence.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(0);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onError(new Exception());
});

Subscription subscription = values
	.all(i -> i % 2 == 0)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
Error: java.lang.Exception
```

If, however, the predicate fails, then `false` is emitted and the sequence terminates. Even if the source observable fails after that, the event is ignored. Remember that it is Rx's contract that nothing is emitted after a termination of an observable.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onError(new Exception());
});

Subscription subscription = values
	.all(i -> i % 2 == 0)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
false
Completed
```

## exists

The exists method returns an observable that will emit `true` if any of the values emitted by the observable make the predicate true.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/exists.png)

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0, 2);
		
Subscription subscription = values
	.exists(i -> i > 2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
false
Completed
```

Here our range didn't go high enough for the `i > 2` condition to succeed. If we extend our range in the same example with
```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0, 2);
```
We will get a successful result
```
true
Completed
```

## isEmpty

This operator's result is a boolean value, indicating if an observable emitted values before completing or not.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/isEmpty.png)

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.timer(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
Subscription subscription = values
	.isEmpty()
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
false
Completed
```

Once again, falsehood is established as soon as the first value is emitted. True will only be returned once the source observable has terminated.

## contains

The method `contains` establishes if a particular element is emitter by an observable. `contains` will use the `Object.equals` function to establish the equality. Just like previous operators, it emits its decision as soon as it can be established and immediately completes.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/contains.png)

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
Subscription subscription = values
	.contains(4L)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
true
Completed
```

If we had used `contains(4)` where we used `contains(4L)`, nothing would be printed. That's because `4` and `4L` are not equal in Java. Our code would wait for the observable to complete to return false, only the observable we used is infinite.

## defaultIfEmpty

If an empty sequence would cause you problems, rather than checking with `isEmpty` and handling the case, you can force an obserable to emit a value on completion if didn't emit anything before completing.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/defaultIfEmpty.png)

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0,10);
		
Subscription subscription = values
    .take(0)
	.defaultIfEmpty(2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
2
Completed
```

Here we emptied an observable with `take(0)`. We could have used `Observable.empty`.

The value is emitted only if no other values appeared and only on successful completion. If the source is not empty, the result is just the source observable. In the case of the error, the default value will _not_ be emitted before the error.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.error(new Exception());
		
Subscription subscription = values
	.defaultIfEmpty(2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
Error: java.lang.Exception
```

## elementAt

You can select exactly one element our of an observable using the `elementAt` method

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/elementAt.png)

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(100, 10);
		
Subscription subscription = values
	.elementAt(2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
102
Completed
```

If the sequence doesn't have enough items, an `java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException` will be emitted. To avoid that specific case, we can provide a default value that will be emitted instead of an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(100, 10);
		
Subscription subscription = values
	.elementAtOrDefault(22, 0)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
0
Completed
```

## sequenceEqual

The last method establishes that two sequences are equal by comparing the value at the same indices. Both the size of the sequences and the values must be equal. The function will either use `Object.equals` or the function that you supply to compare values.

```java
Observable<String> strings = Observable.just("1", "2", "3");
Observable<Integer> ints = Observable.just(1, 2, 3);

Observable.sequenceEqual(strings, ints, (s,i) -> s.equals(i.toString()))
//Observable.sequenceEqual(strings, ints)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
true
Completed
```

If we had used the overload that was commented out (i.e the standard `Object.equals`), the result would be `false`.

Failing is not part of the comparison. As soon as either sequence fails, the resulting observable forwards the error.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onError(new Exception());
});

Observable.sequenceEqual(values, values)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Output
```
Error: java.lang.Exception
```
