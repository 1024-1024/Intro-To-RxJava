# Aggregation

We've seen how to cut away parts of a sequence that we don't want, how to get single values, how to inspect the contents of sequence and how to deal with that information. Those things can be seen as reasoning about the containing sequence. Now we will see how we can use the raw data in the sequence to produce meaningful values.

The methods we will see here resemble what is called catamorphism. In our case, it would mean that the methods that all the values in the sequence and compose them into one. However, they do not strictly meet the definition, as they don't return a single value. Rather, they return an observable that promises to emit a single value.

If you've been reading through all of the examples, you should have noticed some repetition. To do away with that and to focus on what matters, we will now introduce a custom `Subscriber`, which we will use in our examples.

```java
class PrintSubscriber extends Subscriber{
	private final String name;
	public PrintSubscriber(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	@Override
	public void onCompleted() {
		System.out.println(name + ": Completed");
	}
	@Override
	public void onError(Throwable e) {
		System.out.println(name + ": Error: " + e);
	}
	@Override
	public void onNext(Object v) {
		System.out.println(name + ": " + v);
	}
}
```

This is a very basic implementation that prints every event to the console, along with a helpful tag.

### count

Our first method is `count`. It serves the same purpose as `length` and `size`, found in Java collections. This method will return an observable that waits until the sequence completes and emits the number of values in the source.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/count.png)

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0, 3);

values
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Values"));
values
	.count()
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Count"));
```

```
Values: 0
Values: 1
Values: 2
Values: Completed
Count: 3
Count: Completed
```

There is also `countLong` for sequences that may exceed the capacity of a standard integer.

### first

`first` will return an observable that emits only the first value in a sequence. It is similar to `take(1)`, except that it will emit `java.util.NoSuchElementException` if none is found. If you use the overload that takes a predicate, the first value that matches the predicate is returned.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

values
	.first(v -> v>5)
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("First"));
```

Instead of getting a `java.util.NoSuchElementException`, you can use `firstOrDefault` to get a default value when the sequence is empty.

### last

`last` and `lastOrDefault` work in the same way, only the item returned is the last item before the sequence completed. When using the overload with a predicate, the item returned is the last item that matched the predicate.

### single

`single` emits the only value in the sequence, or the only value that met predicate when one is given. It differs from `first` and `last` in that it does not ignore multiple matches. If multiple matches are found, it will emit an error. It can be used to assert that a sequence must only contain one such value.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/single.p.png)

Remember that single must check the entire sequence to ensure your assertion.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
values.take(10)
	.single(v -> v == 5L) // Emits a result
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Single1"));
values
	.single(v -> v == 5L) // Never emits
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Single2"));
```

Output
```
Single1: 5
Single1: Completed
```

Like in with previous methods, you can have a default value with `singleOrDefault`

## Custom aggregators

The methods we saw on this chapter so far don't seem that different from the ones in previous chapters. We will now see two very powerful methods that will greatly expand what we can do with an observable. Many of the methods we've seen so far can be implemented using those.

### reduce

You may have heard of `reduce` from MapReduce. Otherwise, you might have met it under the names "aggregate", "accumulate" or "fold". The general idea is that you produce a single value out of many by combining them two at a time. It its most basic overload, all you need is a function that combines two values into one.

```java
public final Observable<T> reduce(Func2<T,T,T> accumulator)
```
![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/reduce.png)

This is best explained with an example. Here we will calculate the sum of a sequence of integers: 0+1+2+3+4=10 and separately the minimum value;

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0,5);
		
values
	.reduce((i1,i2) -> i1+i2)
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Sum"));
values
	.reduce((i1,i2) -> (i1>i2) ? i2 : i1)
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Min"));
```

Output
```
Sum: 10
Sum: Completed
Min: 0
Min: Completed
```

`reduce` in Rx is not identical to "reduce" in parallel systems. In the context of parallel systems, it implies that the pairs of values can be choosen arbitrarily so that multiple machines can work independently. In Rx, the `accumulator` function is applied in sequence from left to right (as seen on the marble diagram). Each time, the accumulator function combines the result of the previous accumulations with the next value. This is more obvious in the other overload:

```java
public final <R> Observable<R> reduce(R initialValue, Func2<R,? super T,R> accumulator)
```

The accumulator returns a different type than the one in the observable. The first argument of the accumulator is the previous partial result of the accumulation process and the second in the next value. To begin the process, an initial value is supplied. We will demonstrate this process by reimplementing `count`

```java
Observable<String> values = Observable.just("Rx", "is", "easy");
		
values
	.reduce(0, (acc,next) -> acc + 1)
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Count"));
```

Output
```
Count: 3
Count: Completed
```

`reduce` can be used to implement the functionality of most of the operators that emit a single value. It can not implement behaviour where a value is emitted before the source completes. So, you can implement `last` using `reduce`, but an implementation of `all` would not behave exactly like the original.

### scan

`scan` is very similar to `reduce`, with the key difference being that `scan` will emit all the intermediate results.

```java
public final Observable<T> scan(Func2<T,T,T> accumulator)
```
![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/scan.png)

In the case of our example for a sum, using `scan` will produce a running sum.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0,5);
		
values
	.scan((i1,i2) -> i1+i2)
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Sum"));
```

Output
```
Sum: 0
Sum: 1
Sum: 3
Sum: 6
Sum: 10
Sum: Completed
```

`scan` is more general than `reduce`, since `reduce` can be implemented with `scan`: `reduce(acc) = scan(acc).takeLast()`

`scan` emits when the source emits and does not need the source to complete. We demonstrate that by implementing an observable that returns a running minimum:

```java
Subject<Integer, Integer> values = ReplaySubject.create();
		
values
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Values"));
values
	.scan((i1,i2) -> (i1<i2) ? i1 : i2)
	.distinctUntilChanged()
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("Min"));

values.onNext(2);
values.onNext(3);
values.onNext(1);
values.onNext(4);
values.onCompleted();
```

Output
```
Values: 2
Min: 2
Values: 3
Values: 1
Min: 1
Values: 4
Values: Completed
Min: Completed
```

### Aggregation to collections

In `reduce` nothing is stopping your accumulator from being a collection. You can use `reduce` to collect every value in `Observable<T>` into a `List<T>`.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(10,5);
		
values
	.reduce(
		new ArrayList<Integer>(),
		(acc, value) -> {
			acc.add(value);
			return acc;
		})
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
```
Output
```
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
```

You don't have to do this manually. Rxjava offers a variety of operators for collecting your sequence into a container. Those aggregators return an observable that will emit the corresponding collection when it is ready.

#### toList

The example above could be implemented as 

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(10,5);
		
values
	.toList()
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
```

#### toSortedList

The `toSortedList` aggregator works like `toList`, except that the resulting list is sorted. Here are the signatures:

```java
public final Observable<java.util.List<T>> toSortedList()
public final Observable<java.util.List<T>> toSortedList(
	Func2<? super T,? super T,java.lang.Integer> sortFunction)
```

As we can see, we can either use the default comparison for the objects, or supply our own sorting function. The sorting function follows the semantics of `Comparator`'s [compare](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#compare%28T,%20T%29) method.

In this example, we sort integers in reverse order with a custom sort function

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(10,5);
		
values
	.toSortedList((i1,i2) -> i2 - i1)
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
```
Output
```
[14, 13, 12, 11, 10]
```

#### toMap

`toMap` turns our sequence of `T` into a `Map<TKey,T>`. There are 3 overloads

```java
public final <K> Observable<java.util.Map<K,T>> toMap(
	Func1<? super T,? extends K> keySelector)
public final <K,V> Observable<java.util.Map<K,V>> toMap(
	Func1<? super T,? extends K> keySelector,
	Func1<? super T,? extends V> valueSelector)
public final <K,V> Observable<java.util.Map<K,V>> toMap(
	Func1<? super T,? extends K> keySelector,
	Func1<? super T,? extends V> valueSelector,
	Func0<? extends java.util.Map<K,V>> mapFactory)
```

`keySelector` is a function that produces a key from a value. `valueSelector` produces from the emitted value the actual value that will be stored in the map. `mapFactory` creates the collection that will hold the items.

Lets start with an example of the simple overload. We want to map people to their age. We start with a data structure

```java
class Person {
	public final String name;
	public final Integer age;
	public Person(String name, int age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
}
```
```java
Observable<Person> values = Observable.just(
	new Person("Will", 25),
	new Person("Nick", 40),
	new Person("Saul", 35)
);

values
	.toMap(person -> person.name)
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("toMap"));
```
Output
```
toMap: {Saul=Person@7cd84586, Nick=Person@30dae81, Will=Person@1b2c6ec2}
toMap: Completed
```

Now we will only use the age as a value

```java
Observable<Person> values = Observable.just(
	new Person("Will", 25),
	new Person("Nick", 40),
	new Person("Saul", 35)
);

values
	.toMap(
		person -> person.name,
		person -> person.age)
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("toMap"));
```
Output
```
toMap: {Saul=35, Nick=40, Will=25}
toMap: Completed
```

If we want to be explicit about the container that will be used or initialise it, we can supply our own:

```java
values
	.toMap(
		person -> person.name,
		person -> person.age,
		() -> new HashMap())
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("toMap"));
```

#### toMultimap

When mapping, it is very common that many values share the same key. We call it "grouping" and the datastructure for this is a multimap, a map from keys to collections

```java
public final <K> Observable<java.util.Map<K,java.util.Collection<T>>> toMultimap(
	Func1<? super T,? extends K> keySelector)
public final <K,V> Observable<java.util.Map<K,java.util.Collection<V>>> toMultimap(
	Func1<? super T,? extends K> keySelector,
	Func1<? super T,? extends V> valueSelector)
public final <K,V> Observable<java.util.Map<K,java.util.Collection<V>>> toMultimap(
	Func1<? super T,? extends K> keySelector,
	Func1<? super T,? extends V> valueSelector,
	Func0<? extends java.util.Map<K,java.util.Collection<V>>> mapFactory)
public final <K,V> Observable<java.util.Map<K,java.util.Collection<V>>> toMultimap(
	Func1<? super T,? extends K> keySelector,
    Func1<? super T,? extends V> valueSelector,
    Func0<? extends java.util.Map<K,java.util.Collection<V>>> mapFactory,
    Func1<? super K,? extends java.util.Collection<V>> collectionFactory)
```

And here is an example where we group by age. 

```java
Observable<Person> values = Observable.just(
	new Person("Will", 35),
	new Person("Nick", 40),
	new Person("Saul", 35)
);

values
	.toMultimap(
		person -> person.age,
		person -> person.name)
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("toMap"));
```
Output
```
toMap: {35=[Will, Saul], 40=[Nick]}
toMap: Completed
```

The first three overloads are familiar from `toMap`. The fourth allows us to provide not only the `Map` but also the `Collection` that the values will be stored in. The collection can be customised according to the corresponding key:

```java
Observable<Person> values = Observable.just(
	new Person("Will", 35),
	new Person("Nick", 40),
	new Person("Saul", 35)
);

values
	.toMultimap(
		person -> person.age,
		person -> person.name,
		() -> new HashMap(),
		(key) -> new ArrayList())
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("toMap"));
```

#### Note

The operators just presented have actually very limited use. It is tempting for a beginner to collect the data in a collection and process them in the traditional way. That should be avoided not just for didactic purposed, but because this way defeats the advantages of using Rx in the first place.


### groupBy

The last general function that we will see for now is `groupBy`. It is the Rx way of doing `toMultimap`. For each value, it calculates a key and groups the values into separate observables based on that key.

```java
public final <K> Observable<GroupedObservable<K,T>> groupBy(Func1<? super T,? extends K> keySelector)
```

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/groupBy.png)

The return value is an observable of observables. Every time a new key is met, a new inner `GroupedObservable` will be emitted. That type is nothing more than a standard observable with a `getKey()` accessor, for getting the group's key. As values come from the source observable, they will be emitted by the observable with the corresponding key.

The nested obseravbles may complicate the signature, but they allow the groups to start emitting their items before the source observable has completed.

In the next example, we will take a set of words and, for each starting letter, we will print the last word that occured.

```java
Observable<String> values = Observable.just(
		"first",
		"second",
		"third",
		"forth",
		"fifth",
		"sixth"
);

values.groupBy(word -> word.charAt(0))
	.subscribe(
		group -> group.last()
			.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(group.getKey() + ": " + v))
	);
```

The above example works, but it is a bad idea to have nested `subscribe`s. You can do the same with 

```java
Observable<String> values = Observable.just(
		"first",
		"second",
		"third",
		"forth",
		"fifth",
		"sixth"
);

values.groupBy(word -> word.charAt(0))
	.flatMap(group -> 
		group.last().map(v -> group.getKey() + ": " + v)
	)
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
```
Output
```
s: sixth
t: third
f: fifth
```

We will formally introduce `map` and `flatMap` in the next chapter.

# Nested observables

Nested observables may be confusing at first, but they are a powerful construct that has many uses. We borrow some nice examples, as outlined in www.introtorx.com


 * Partitions of Data
    * You may partition data from a single source so that it can easily be filtered and shared to many sources. Partitioning data may also be useful for aggregates as we have seen. This is commonly done with the GroupBy operator. 
 * Online Game servers
    * Consider a sequence of servers. New values represent a server coming online. The value itself is a sequence of latency values allowing the consumer to see real time information of quantity and quality of servers available. If a server went down then the inner sequence can signify that by completing. 
 * Financial data streams
    * New markets or instruments may open and close during the day. These would then stream price information and could complete when the market closes. 
 * Chat Room
    * Users can join a chat (outer sequence), leave messages (inner sequence) and leave a chat (completing the inner sequence). 
 * File watcher
    * As files are added to a directory they could be watched for modifications (outer sequence). The inner sequence could represent changes to the file, and completing an inner sequence could represent deleting the file.
